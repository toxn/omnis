# omnis
Object-oriented Multi-Node Information System

Concept:
Omnis is an environment/plateform meant to bring various technical paradigms to the general user with no specific regard to compatibility with older OSes.

Those paradigms include:
 Â - Object-Oriented: Omnis doesn't provide applications directly to the user. Programs are a result of a programmer / mathematician approach. In a real-life approach, one will put the project before the tool. In respect to this point of view, the user will be presented with data (projects, objects, resources) instead of programs.
  This paradigms offers many advantages for the user:
    * Branding is masked: User doesn't have to choose between several softwares with varying advantages, Uis or licencing. He want's to create an image; he just selects 'Create new Image'. He wants to modify a video; he just searches for the video and selects 'Modify'. In fact branding is defered to the administrator, who will choose the default class to be used for this or that, install new modules, choose or modify the default UI for each type of datum.
    * Software price is reduced to added value: As standard APIs evolve, the administrator needs just buy the classes that really had some value over free software that become intergrated in the standard APIs. No need to spend money or resources on software that is already available for free and is open and community maintain. Software vendors are incited to provide added value on the object and service levels, which spurs innovation rather than imitation.
  - Persistence
  - Multi-Nodality
  - Scalability
